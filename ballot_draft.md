Code4Lib Community Vote on Fiscal Continuity Options
====================================================

The purpose of this vote is to determine the will of the Code4Lib community, as it relates to ongoing fiscal continuity of our annual conferences, journal, and other undertakings. The options referenced in this ballot are detailed here: https://wiki.code4lib.org/FCIG_Report, and the questions below assume that you are familiar with the entirety of the report.

Method of Voting
----------------
This ballot uses score voting, which allows for awarding scores to each choice on the ballot to reflect the strength of voters’ preferences among all available options. More info on the rationale for score voting is available here: https://electology.org/score-voting

Ballot Instructions
-------------------
For each item in the ballot questions below, choose the score you wish to assign from 0-3.

0 = least favored; 3 = most favored; so, when votes are tallied, the items with the highest point totals overall win the vote. 

You may assign scores to as many items as you like, and items’ scores are independent of one another (i.e., multiple items may be given the same score).

Any Questions about this Process? Ask them on the C4L List! 
-----------------------------------------------------------
This voting period is a time for open discussion, debate, and community analysis of the information presented in the FCIG Report. If you have any questions about the FCIG report, this ballot, or any of the options provided, ask your questions on the Code4Lib listserv so that the community can discuss them and so that previous conference volunteers, FCIG members, and potential fiscal sponsors can provide more details as needed.
